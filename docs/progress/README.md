# Progress Tracking

## Friday

>  Reviewed a little bit of everything to get a foothold on a plan forward. I chose a project that I thought would be an easy blockchain project. The project I chose was "Certifications for training videos".

## Saturday & Sunday

> Focused on learning basics of Blockchain technology. Watched videos and read a volume of information.

> Reviewed video's on "Solidity" to get a general feel and overall starting point for Monday morning. Wrote a most basic "hello world".  

> Learned (at a most basic level) the Svelte/Sapper/Tailwind frontend stack that I wanted to learn.

> Investigated the current business domain and found it to be more involved than originally thought.  Determined that the standard format of "Open Badges" should be used.

## Monday 

:white_check_mark: = An ask on interview github page

> :white_check_mark: "Fork this repo" [/github.com/ScottLare/collideOh](https://github.com/ScottLare/collideOh)

> :white_check_mark: "Choose a use case you think would be interesting to build as a decentralized application"  

* Training Certifications

> :white_check_mark:  "Run through our Quick Start".

> :white_check_mark: [Created simple instructions to follow for deployment onto Kaleido platform](quickstart.html)  

> Set up VS Code environment.  Added an extension named "Solidity".  

<!-- 
* Other extensions may have value later, in particular an extension from MS if/when using Azure Cloud and the "Blockchain Development Kit for Ethereum"

* This MS extension has built in integration for open source tools such as Truffle, Infura, and OpenZeppelin.

* ETHover looks interesting?

**Note** Watch periodically what "ETHCode" extension is trying to do differently if anything.  Currently new, no stars, 216 users.  Maybe become something? Same for "Ethereum Essentials" Put both in calendar to check in 6 months.

-->

<!--
**Note** fyi - Vyper is another language, but it seems weaker and not as popular as Solidity.  
-->

> Learned the IDE - Remix

<!--
*Extra - Not part of requirements in challenge but helpful and soon or later necessary -> Learn to use the accelerators
-->

## Tuesday

>> :white_check_mark:   Added documentation on SMELTE frontend development.

* [Steps for re-creating front-end using SMELTE](/development/frontend)

> Remaining

1. Have on-chain Smart Contract logic, written in Solidity

2. Have a backend-for-the-frontend (BFF), written in Node.js

3. Have a Web based user experience, built in React  (SMELTE)
 I still need to connect the frontend up and then add svelte components and make them work/interact with backend)

4. Contain a README that gives a quick overview of the use case, and tells us how to run it 

> * Write a message [string] that represents the recipients certificate or name of recipient to the blockchain, and investigate how to use it in the overall process flow.  

## Wednesday - other commitments

<!-- 
## Completed:

:white_check_mark: 1) Notice Peter's Pragma statement above.

pragma solidity >=0.4.24 <0.6.0;
```
Per Peter help I changed to <0.7.1; this morning and the red squiqqly disappered :thumbsup:

:white_check_mark: 2) Nick's video mentioned two ez ways to deploy to Kaleido.
     a) Directly from Github Rep
     b) Load the source from my laptop.
