# ABIEncoderV2 NOTES & PROGRESS

"ABIEncoderV2
The new ABI encoder is able to encode and decode arbitrarily nested arrays and structs. It might produce less optimal
code and has not received as much testing as the old encoder, but is considered non-experimental as of Solidity
0.6.0. You still have to explicitly activate it using pragma experimental ABIEncoderV2; - we kept the
same pragma, even though it is not considered experimental anymore."
